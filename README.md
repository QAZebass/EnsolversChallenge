###Ensolvers Chalenge###

In this repository you can find the test cases I wrote for the website https://qa-challenge.ensolvers.com/.

Initially, in the use cases, I wrote two that were negative cases. I decided not to write test cases based on those case uses since they were going to fail.
What I did do was write test case EC-011 in which the user should be able to delete a folder. I wrote it because when I first carried out an exploratory test,
I could delete 8 out of 10 folders, but when I was writing the test cases, I could barely delete some folders. I left it skipped so the CI could pass.

Also, in EC-001, there was a huge issue with the form to type in the name of the item. Sometimes the text was written, some other times it was half written and 
other times it wasn't written at all. I somehow managed to write names in it but it could still fail.

It took a lot of time and effort to write the tests but I could find the solutions for the problems I faced alongs the way.
